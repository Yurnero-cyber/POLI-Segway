# POLI USP - Segway
Simple and easy to use, this repository has all the code necessary to make a two-wheel segway, using only the necessary Arduino components.

The project has been finished, however feel free to contact me as much as you like.

# **Story**
The original idea for this project of mine was to create a simple guide for all engineering students that aspired to create **something** (*anything!*) for themselves, instead of always sistematically practicing last years' tests only to vomit lots of equations, in order to reach a 5.0 mark in some impossible test. Doesn't really makes sense to overcomplicate our lives with these, since technology is always advancing.

So what I did was to record my experience building a Segway from scratch, without knowing exactly what a Uno was, never used PID (I learned it, not used it) and not a clue of how to use a soldering tip. For me, it's hard to imagine a mechanical engineer that does not know how to solder, so for me it was a cool achievement.

That's it. I hope you have fun like I had using these info and maybe help improving it, since at that time I was like anyone, a complete amateur.

# **Why Segway?**
The best part in the mechanical engineering course is Control. I know i know, but making a robot that stands by itself is amazing. So amazing it makes you think that creating something like this is nearly impossible, but in reality it is just a little difficult (which is, a *lot* of difference!).

# **Hardest Parts**
For me, the hardest part of the whole robot was tuning the gyroscope, and you can have a better life quality reading this link: (https://www.geekmomprojects.com/gyroscopes-and-accelerometers-on-a-chip/). Thanks, Geek Mom.

# **Possible Upgrades**
This segway used two normal motors, that *do not have encoders*. That being said, a whole lot of improvement is possible could use better control routines.
